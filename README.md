# QUIKSend
A quick way to send emails using a program and a GUI created in Python by myself.

### Installation:
1. Clone the repo/type `git clone https://github.com/jackokeeffe/QUIKSend.git` into your command prompt.
2. If your outermost folder is not reelSRCH type `cd QUIKSend` into your command prompt (for IDE's).
3. Type `python setup.py install` into your command prompt. Wait for it to finish installing/loading indices.
4. Run the code and follow the instructions in the GUI.

### How-To:
- Google has security measures in place to make accounts more secure, this stops you from sending emails in python.
- To send emails using this program you must allow third-party apps in Google Account security settings.
- To turn on less secure apps read [this](https://hotter.io/docs/email-accounts/secure-app-gmail/).
